## Labella

Labella is an augmented system that employs non-traditional on-body interactions and explores the potential of using a mobile device as an interface to discover and learn about hidden parts of the body. The system is designed to support pelvic fitness in women. It blends wearable and mobile technologies with modern lifestyle by combining a pair of underwear for embodied playful interaction, and a mobile phone as a tool for embodied discovery.

The mobile phone app connects to the female body through the recognition of bespoke printed markers on specialist underwear. This playful interaction was used to situate an Augmented Reality experience, and the experience of the app more broadly against the user's body - making this an exemplar project of how we can design and consider intimate interactions.

Labella was created by Teresa Almedia, Rob Comber, Gavin Wood and Madeline Balaam at Open Lab, Newcastle University.
